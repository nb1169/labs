# incidents.py

# This file previously contained procedural database functions 
# (get_all_incidents, update_incident_status, delete_incident).

# As part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) refactoring 
# required for Week 11, all data access logic has been moved. 
# This file is now empty to enforce the use of the new architecture.

# Use the DatabaseManager service class and SecurityIncident entity class instead.
# e.g., from services.database_manager import DatabaseManager
